# Artificial Intelligence for Embedded Systems - TUM Course 2018 

## Lung Cancer Nodule Classification Using Deep Neural Networks


This is repository contains the semester long project for one of the courses at Technical University of Munich. 
Course taught Yiyu Shi,Ph.D. University of Notre Dame.

The course was mainly about AI and all the methods and techniques used to make neural networks feasible for embedded systems.
Below is a list of what was covered in the lectures.

 
	● Data preprocessing & background 
	● Linear regression 
	● Clustering 
	● Perceptron & logistic regression 
	● Neural network 
	● Deep learning  
	● IntroductiontoPython/Tensorflow(Lab) 
	● Support vector machine 
	● Decision tree 
	● Neuromorphiccomputing
	● Embeddedhardware fabrics  
	● Neural Network acceleration and compression
	● Network compression on Tensorflow (Lab) 


The grade passing requirement was a project in which we had to perform any deep learning task and perform Compression on our model. 
The whole project was implemented on python and ported to raspberry Pi for demonstration.

### Requirements

* Python 3.3+
* numpy==1.16.6
* keras==2.4.3

### Installation
